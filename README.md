## Bugs

~~1. The list of related artists renders unpredictably. Often you will need to repeat a search to see it.~~

~~2. The list of saved searches (in the account area) renders unpredictably. Often you will need to refresh the page to update it.~~

~~3. If the user searches for a film => then logs in and already has an edited saved version => the search results do not immediately update. The user must click search again to see their edited results.~~
